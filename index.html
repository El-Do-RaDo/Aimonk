<h1 style="margin:auto;">Artificial General Intelligence</h1>
<img src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*QiDrhzVsl3N3sg-h_5r7TA.jpeg">

<p>An Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would be a machine capable of understanding the world as well as any human, and with the same capacity to learn how to carry out a huge range of tasks.
AGI can also be referred to as strong AI ,Full AI, general intelligent action.
In theory, an artificial general intelligence could carry out any task a human could, and likely many that a human couldn't. At the very least, an AGI would be able to combine human-like, flexible thinking and reasoning with computational advantages, such as near-instant recall and split-second number crunching.
It involves a system with comprehensive knowledge and cognitive computing capabilities such that its performance is indistinguishable from that of a human.</P>

<h2 style="margin:auto;"> What's Missing In A.I</h2>
<p> AI is preprogrammed to carry out a task that a human can but more efficiently, artificial general intelligence (AGI) expects the machine to be just as smart as a human or better than human.AI is based on human cognition and AGI is based on Human Intellectual ability.</p>

<h2 style="margin:auto;"> Our Vision</h2>
<p> AIMonk is an open source AGI related community where every passionate member can contribute.
Our vision is to build a team where me myself and all the members will be proud to be the part of, anyone who is passionate for AI and AGI, and is willing to research and develop in this domain are welcomed, you can share your ideas about projects and collaborate with us ,or contribute in our working project, you can share your blogs and ideas with us.</p>
