It's generally hard to communicate with the one's who cannot speak. Most of the time they try to communicate with us using sign language but most of people don't know what is sign language and cant communicate with it. This being the issue the one's who cannot speak are left with a disadvantage of not able to express what the feel.

Technology these days have advanced to a scale where phones are now being smart and computers have too high computation powers. So what if our smart phones and computers are able to learn and recognize sign language. With that achieved it will be so much easier to communicate with the one's who can't speak. So here we have a project with an idea that using AI, Deep Learning where we create a system that watches the sign language and converts it to words/audio. Now that would make it so much easier to communicate.

We will update this blog as our research progresses and if you are entusiastic in this research and have any ideas please contact us, post a comment and we will reach you on the provided e-mail.
